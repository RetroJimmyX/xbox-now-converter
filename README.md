The purpose of this program is to enable the text copied from the webpage https://www.xbox-now.com/en/deal-list to then be tidied to import to a spreadsheet.

Steps:
1. Visit https://www.xbox-now.com/en/deal-list in a regular web browser
2. Ensure filters are used and the currency settings to correctly display listings from a desired region.
3. Highlight the bottom listing, hold Shift and highlight the top listing and copy to clipboard.
4. Open up a text file and paste into that text file and save as "try.txt"
5. Execute this Python program (in the same directory as the text file).
6. Save the output to a text file, which can then be imported into spreadsheet software easily.

Notes:
The output values are seperated by ** (not commas)
The website regularly changes its output and formatting so this nuanced script may become obsolete easily
Non-English characters and symbols such as tradmark or regisatered or copyright seem to spit out garbage or crash the program.
